# Demo app for '[flutter_map](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map)'

Showcases functionality of the library in a neat and useful format that can be used for further API references, and just to see if you want this library for your app.

See the [documentation website](https://docs.fleaflet.dev/) for more information about flutter_map.

## How To Run

To run this example application, clone this repository/directory onto your local machine. Open your emulator or connect your device, then use your IDE as you normally would, or execute `flutter clean` & `flutter run` from a terminal. Note that there are no pre-built versions available.

## What's Inside

Each page inside the example application usually demonstrates a specific feature. Pages can be accessed through the draw in app, and have self-explanatory names both in app and for each source code file - of which there is (mostly) one per page.
