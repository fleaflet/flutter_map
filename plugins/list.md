# Plugins List

There are many independently maintained 'plugins' created by the 'flutter\_map' community that give extra, prebuilt functionality, saving you even more time and potentially money.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Although these plugins have been checked by 'flutter\_map' maintainers, 'flutter\_map' maintainers do not accept responsibility for any issues or threats posed by independently maintained plugins.

Use plugins at your own risk.

Some pages in this documentation provide direct links to these plugins, where appropriate, to make it easier for you to find a suitable plugin: these are listed below as well. Other links in documentation may point to useful libraries, but not necessarily flutter\_map dedicated plugins: these are not listed below.

However, if you're just browsing, a list is provided below (in no particular order), containing many of the open-source plugins, each with a short description by the author saying what the plugin does/what it's useful for:
