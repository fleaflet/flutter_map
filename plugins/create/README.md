# Creating Plugins

Plugins extend flutter\_map's functionality. There's no specific definition, but they often offer additional utilities and/or layers.

If one of the [independently maintained plugins](../list.md) doesn't suit your needs, then you can create your own, to achieve maximum customizability.

## Submitting A New Plugin

If you've made your own plugin that you're willing to share, please let us know in the #plugins channel on the flutter\_map Discord server. We can then add it to the [list.md](../list.md "mention"). We're always looking forward to see what you've made!

When submitting a plugin, please ensure the plugin:

* _preferably_ includes <kbd>flutter\_map\_</kbd> in the name, by convention
* _preferably_ includes the <kbd>#flutter-map</kbd> pub.dev topic
* is available via a standard pub.dev package installation
* includes good documentation (at least to setup basic functionality), and a code example
