# ðŸš€ What's New In v8.2?

## Overview

Here's some highlights since v8.0:

{% hint style="success" %}
## **Automatically enabled lightweight built-in caching & aborting of in-flight HTTP requests for obsolete tiles**

The `NetworkTileProvider` has had a massive functionality boost!

Built-in caching helps you, your users, and the tile server, and is enabled by default for maximum ease. You could also switch it out with a custom implementation, or disable it altogether if you prefer. Find out more in [caching.md](../layers/tile-layer/caching.md "mention").

You may be using the `CancellableNetworkTileProvider`, which allowed in-flight HTTP requests to be aborted when the tiles would no longer be displayed, helping to improve performance and usability. Unfortunately, it isn't compatible with built-in caching. Fortunately, it's also been deprecated - its functionality is now available in the core! 'package:http' v1.5.0-beta ([#1773](https://github.com/dart-lang/http/pull/1773)) supports aborting requests with the 3 default clients natively, so Dio is no longer required. This makes it easier for you and for us!

{% hint style="success" %}
## &#x20;**Inverted filling for `PolygonLayer` & multi-yet-single world support for `Poly*Layer`**

This continues the work on multi-world support (thanks monsieurtanuki), and fixes an issue that occured where users used a `Polygon` covering the entire world, with holes as cut outs.

_This feature was bounty-funded, thanks to our generous_ [supporters.md](../thanks/supporters.md "mention")_, and the community! We hope to open more bounties in future._
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## No more grey background at the North and South edges of your map (optionally)

Thanks to the community, a new `ContainCameraLatitude` `CameraConstraint` is available, which keeps just the world in view at all times. At the moment, it still needs enabling manually.

Check out the effect in our demo for [multi-world functionality](https://demo.fleaflet.dev/repeated_worlds). You can enable it in your project just by passing the object to the `MapOptions.cameraConstraint` option.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## Polygon label placement improvements

This is split into 3 parts:

* The old method of picking a placement algorithm has been deprecated and been replaced with a new, extensible system - it's still just as easy to use as the old one
* Thanks to the community, a new placement algorithm has been added: an improved centroid algorithm using the 'signed area centroid' algorithm - this is the new default, but the old algorithm is still available
* The polylabel placement algorithm has been given a fresh lick of paint and uses a more modern Dart implementation to improve performance and customizability

See how to migrate to the new system below.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
## Documentation improvements

This documentation has also had a bit of a renewal!

* Follow the new guide to setup a `TileLayer` as we recommend: [#recommended-setup](../layers/tile-layer/#recommended-setup "mention"). More to come soon!
* The guide for interactive layers has been simplified, reworked, and example added. Check it out: [layer-interactivity](../layers/layer-interactivity/ "mention").
* We've added some information about using flutter\_map with the OpenStreetMap public tile servers: [using-openstreetmap-direct.md](../tile-servers/using-openstreetmap-direct.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Information will appear in console when a `TileLayer` is loaded using one of the OpenStreetMap tile servers (in debug mode)

Additionally, where an appropriate User-Agent header (which identifies your app to the server) is not set - for example, through `TileLayer.userAgentPackageName`, or directly through the tile provider's HTTP headers configuration - a warning will appear in console (in debug mode), advising you to set a UA.

In future, we may block users which do not set a valid UA identifier for this server.

For more information, see [using-openstreetmap-direct.md](../tile-servers/using-openstreetmap-direct.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

That's already a lot, but it's only scratching the surface. Alongside the community, we've improved our example app, [reduced the size of our demo & package](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map/pull/2056), [added even more customizability and fine-grained control](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] - not even to mention the multiple bug fixes and other performance improvements.

For completeness, here were the highlights from v8.0:

* Unbounded horizontal scrolling
* Keyboard controls for map gestures
* Performance improvements (particularly with `Polygon/lineLayer`)

## Migration

### To v8.2

{% hint style="success" %}
v8.2 doesn't contain any API breaking changes, but it does contain deprecations and a small change in potential display output - we suggest preparing for the next breaking release whenever you can
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Changes to <code>Polygon</code> label placement</summary>

It's usually simple to follow the deprecation messages/warnings in your IDE. The changes are described here for completeness.

There's two main changes:

* The default placement algorithm has been changed\
  The new default algorithm adopts the old name (`centroid`), with the old name becoming `simpleCentroid` - it's an improvement over the old algorithm
* The `Polygon.labelPlacement` property & `PolygonLabelPlacement` enum have been deprecated, replaced with `Polygon.labelPlacementCalculator` and `PolygonLabelPlacementCalculator`  respectively

Here's the mapping of old enum values to new objects:

* old default / `.centroid` -> `.centroid()` (new algorithm)
* `.centroidWithMultiWorld` -> `.simpleMultiWorldCentroid()`
* `.polylabel` -> `.polylabel()`
* (new) `.simpleCentroid()`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that only the `simpleMultiWorldCentroid` calculator supports polygons which may lie across the anti-meridian.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary>Deprecation of official <code>CancellableNetworkTileProvider</code> plugin</summary>

As described above, its primary purpose is now fulfilled by default in the `NetworkTileProvider`. You can switch back to that and remove the dependency from your project.

</details>

### To v8.0

{% hint style="success" %}
**Migrating to v8 should be pain-free for most apps, but some major changes are likely for plugins.**

Some breaking changes have been made. The amount of migration required will depend on how much your project uses more advanced functionality. Basic apps are unlikely to require migration.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Most uses of <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-math/Point-class.html"><code>Point&#x3C;double></code></a> replaced by <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Offset-class.html"><code>Offset</code></a> &#x26; <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Size-class.html"><code>Size</code></a>, <a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_map/7.0.1/flutter_map/Bounds-class.html"><code>Bounds&#x3C;double></code></a> by <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Rect-class.html"><code>Rect</code></a>, and <a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_map/7.0.1/flutter_map/Bounds-class.html"><code>Bounds&#x3C;int></code></a> by <code>(IntegerBounds)</code></summary>

With the exception of some areas, uses of 'dart:math' objects, such as `Point`, have been replaced by equivalents from 'dart:ui' and Flutter libraries. There's multiple reasons for this:

* These classes have been described as [legacy since Feb 2024](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/885126e51bf2d0c612a42ba55395ac4f4d9f7b42) in Dart/Flutter, and will be [deprecated in future](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/54852)
* This reduces internal casting (which we did a whole lot) and usage of generic types ([which are inefficient](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/53912)), which has increased performance by around a millisecond or three (in a simple example)
* The tooling and functionality provided by Dart/Flutter reduce the amount we need to maintain internally (reducing duplication), and work better together (such as easily building `Rect`s from `Offset`s and `Size`s

This breaks a large number of coordinate handling functions, such as those converting between geographic coordinates and screen space coordinates (the changed ones) in the `MapCamera`. We've also renamed some of these functions to remove references to 'point' and replace them with 'offset'.

Most migrations should be self explanatory. If necessary, you can [view the PR](https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map/pull/1996) to see what happened to a method you were using - there's very likely a close replacement! Some methods have been moved to internal usage only, but there's always easy alternatives.

Some external libraries still use the previous objects, and some of our use-cases are just not yet ready to be replaced by these options yet, so you may still find some of the old objects hiding around the codebase. `IntegerBounds` is internal only.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>TileLayer.tileSize</code> replaced by <code>tileDimension</code></summary>

Just changing the argument identifier should be enough - we've just restricted the type to be an integer. You can't get tiles in fractional pixels anyway!

This renaming is also persisted throughout the internals.
