        # Feature Request

        Thanks for taking the time to let us know what you want to see! It helps us to improve the experience for you and other developers that may be facing a similar problem. Unfortunately, response times for feature requests are longer than bug reports, as they are lower priority. If you want this functionality implemented quickly, please make a Pull Request to go alongside this feature request.
