Thanks for considering donating to us: we're extremely grateful for all donations of any size!

We'll donate 15% of what we receive to the OpenStreetMap Foundation, as a thanks for their excellent work. The remainder goes directly to improving flutter\_map, whether that's through supporting external contributors through bounties, covering any unforeseen and future costs, or supporting the maintainers.

Donations allow us to keep flutter\_map up-to-date and full of features that save you from expensive tile server fees and that make us Flutter's ‚Ññ1 non-commercially aimed map client.
