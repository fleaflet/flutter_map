## Contributing

'flutter\_map' is only as great as it is because of generous open-source contributors!

We're always happy to receive improvements and fixes, so please submit them whenever you can! A few key points are listed below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Many feature additions are more suitable for plugins, instead of being added to the core.  This is aimed to reduce the future maintenance burden/cost on the maintainers.

If we deny your PR for this reason, please do consider publishing a plugin, and we'll be happy to add it to the [list.md](plugins/list.md "mention")! See [making-a-plugin](plugins/making-a-plugin/ "mention") for more information.

* Always [link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) your PR to at least one issue, and as many as are resolved
* Create a draft PR as soon as work starts, and take it out of draft status when ready for review
* Avoid changing the package version or GitHub workflows
