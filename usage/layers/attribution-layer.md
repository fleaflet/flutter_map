# Attribution Layer

Before publishing your app to users, you should credit the tile server you use, this library, and potentially and plugins you use.

```dart
FlutterMap(
    options: MapOptions(),
    nonRotatedChildren: [
      AttributionWidget.defaultWidget(
        source: '© OpenStreetMap contributors',
        onSourceTapped: () {},
      ),
    ],
),
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Please credit flutter\_map, it helps us to gain more developers that we can help!

You should also credit your tile server if it says to in the server's terms of service. You [must credit OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) if using its tile server or another tile server that relies on its data.
{% endhint %}

## Default Builder

The default builder, as shown above, can be used to get a classic attribution box appearance quickly without much setup. Just add a source and a function (if you want a clickable link to appear), and 'flutter\_map' automatically gets credited.

## Custom Builder

Alternatively, create your own box from scratch by omitting the `defaultWidget` constructor from the widget. Then you can build a custom widget as you would normally.
